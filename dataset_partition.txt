The file shows how the team divided the dataset.
In our way of partitioning the dataset, all the images have been renamed. This means we are not able to provide a list of images in each set since their names are changed and are not the same as the original dataset. The following shows the method we divided the dataset. 

First, we use following script to rename all the images in the folders by number in order.

# !/bin/bash
cd bad_txt
COUNTER=0
for FILE in *.txt; 
	do echo $FILE; 
	let COUNTER=COUNTER+1
	mv $FILE $COUNTER.txt
done

Then, we use shell command to move a number of images into corresponding folders.
For example, "mv 111?.txt test/" moves 10 images into the test folder, and "mv 1??.txt train/" moves 100 images into the training folder.
By using these commands multiple times, we were able to divide the dataset into three different sets following the ratio of number of images in differnet sets provided in the paper.
